sudo yum install -y epel-release

sudo yum install -y ansible



The EPEL repository is not installed on CentOS Stream by default. Once added, we can install
Ansible. Remember we only need Ansible software installed on a single system. We want you to
be able to choose and learn to install Ansible on more than a single Linux system.
